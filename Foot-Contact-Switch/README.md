## Foot Contact Switch

* until now, no Foot contact switch has been added.

* The Foot-contact switch wires are glued to the bottom of the "Upper Leg Base":

### The SS39ET Chip
* Datasheet: DATASHEET-honeywell-sensing-ss39et-ss49e-ss59et-datasheet-005850-4-EN.pdf

* 3.3V or 5V Supply Voltage
* linear Output according to magentic field strength (see datasheet).

### The PCB Board
A small PCB Was designed to hold the chip. It has two mounting holes.

### CHanges to the .stl Files

* The foot was modified to accompany a small magnet and the sensor board.
