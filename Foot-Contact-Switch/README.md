## Foot Contact Switch

All about the foot - contact switch using hall effect sensors.

### The SS39ET Chip
* Datasheet: DATASHEET-honeywell-sensing-ss39et-ss49e-ss59et-datasheet-005850-4-EN.pdf

* 3.3V or 5V Supply Voltage
* linear Output according to magentic field strength (see datasheet).

### The PCB Board
A small PCB Was designed to hold the chip. It has two mounting holes.

### CHanges to the .stl Files

* The foot was modified to accompany a small magnet and the sensor board.

* TODO: Images and .stl files coming when parts tested
