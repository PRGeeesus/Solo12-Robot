### Mechanical Changes

All the covers of the leg modules were equipped with a recess of 3mm debth to hold the encoder board. The Motor-shaft was shortened by 3mm aswell. At the end of the shaft now sits a magnet that gives the rotational inofrmation to the AS5074.
Three holes for mounting as well as spacers are also given.

* The STL files for 3d printing the new shells of the 3dof leg can be found here: [STL files 3dof leg](stl_files).
